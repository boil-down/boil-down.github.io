1 Principles

* no switch to a less constraint language (like HTML)
* aims to enable readable ASCII documents
* _but_: no multiplicity in expressive possibilities (bears complexity)
* interpretation is line wise (only)
* semantics are never altered by subsequential lines
* main loop determines where a block starts
* blocks determine where they end 
* blocks determine if and where to apply inline markup
* inline markup cannot span multiple lines
* escaping is done for text regions within a line (not for individual characters) 
* inline markup is short rather than secured against unwanted matches 
  (as it can be escaped easily)
* empty lines only start/end paragraphs (but have no other semantic)
* block nesting is done by consistent indentation
* block start marks are left aligned (after potential indent; except separators)
* start and end marks of inline markups are identical (escaping is an exception)
* inline marks do not use combinations of different characters
