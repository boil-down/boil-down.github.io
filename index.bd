      Hello, world!   [><]

Boildown is a definite flexible 
 [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language]]
that allows low complexity, low footprint implementations while maintaining a 
concise and regular markup.

The language is meant to be interpreted on client site by a "reader" program
wherefore it intentionally constrians what can be expressed without taking
away too much freedom.
Yet, this requires it to have quite a range of marks and style options as no
less constraint language can be used.
